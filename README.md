# DiabloLike
A Diablo-like Map generator.  A learning project in procedural generation and level design.

# Technologies
* Unreal Engine 4.25
* C++

## Requirements
If you just want to look through blueprints then you can do that, but to see the visuals you'll need [Synty Studio's](https://www.syntystudios.com/) Adventure and Knight packages in the Content/Polygon/ directory
and the free [Water Planes](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/water-planes) from Epic Games added to the project.
I do not have the right to distribute these assets.
To play the game in its current form, please download it from my [itch.io page](https://axandros.itch.io/diablo-like-level-generator).
